# peerblocklists

These are blocklists that I have assembled. Some are not updated but will do a basic job of maintaining a good Peerblock setup. 

To add:

1.Extract the .p2p files inside of the .zip to a folder, do not delete this folder ever-- it is where Peerblock will grab the lists from.

2.Go to Peerblock, hit "List Manager".

3.Click "Add", name it, check "Add File", "Browse", and add that list. Click "Block" under Type, and hit okay. 
#Repeat step #3 for every list you want. 

4.After you're done adding your lists, close the window by hitting the X and Peerblock will automatically update the list. (keep an eye on the "Blocking X IPs number to confirm a change, you can also fully restart Peerblock to confirm)

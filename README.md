# PeerBlock Lists

These are blocklists that I have assembled. Some are not updated but will do a basic job of maintaining a good PeerBlock setup. 

To add:

1.Extract the .p2p files inside of the .zip to a folder, do not delete this folder ever-- it is where PeerBlock will grab the lists from.

2.Go to Peerblock, hit "List Manager".

3.Click "Add", name it, check "Add File", "Browse", and add that list. Click "Block" under Type, and hit okay. 
#Repeat step #3 for every list you want. 

4.After you're done adding your lists, close the window by hitting the X and Peerblock will automatically update the list. (keep an eye on the "Blocking X IPs number to confirm a change, you can also fully restart PeerBlock to confirm)


All of these blocklists will lead PeerBlock to block 2.6+ billion IPs.

IF YOU'RE DOING RESEARCH: It may be interesting for you to know that there is a compiled list of national and corporate IPs. For instance, the NORTH_KOREA.p2p file contains the IP address range used in the DPRK. Some of these blocklists also hold known IPs for companies, government departments (foreign and abroad), and firms (Haliburton, marketing agencies, social media, etc.). 



Speaking of Haliburton, I'm currently trying to make my own blocklist to contribute to this. I am compiling IPs known to be associated to Haliburton (the oil company). Why Haliburton? Well, the IPs associated with Haliburton Company are already in other blocklists included in this repo. These IPs, for many PeerBlock users (although primarily public-trackers peer-to-peer users) often times get flagged and blocked by PeerBlock.
